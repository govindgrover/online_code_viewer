# What is this?

Okay so, this site basically displays the Python Scripts from the directory `\_my_codes\python_3_3` on a single page using PHP.

In addition to this, I have used my brother's PHP OOP Logics and the whole functionality of `ams` is made by him only.  

## Note
Knowing that this is a naive approach but again thats when I leanred a bit of PHP and heading over to Python. We possible in future make a new version which will be more efficient as compared to this.

Thank you.
